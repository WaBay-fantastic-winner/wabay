Nice to see you. It's **WuBay**, a template for people to make dreams or ideas come true by fundraising or to make others' dreams or ideas come true by supporting.

We can be various roles in WuBay, such as proposaler, supporters or even either. All you have to do is to take action immediately. 

Show the ideas you coming up with from your inspiration.
